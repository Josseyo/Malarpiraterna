## MÃ¤larpiraternas TrÃ¤dgÃ¥rd

The garden of the Pirates of MÃ¤laren, "MÃ¤larpiraternas TrÃ¤dgÃ¥rd", is located by a popular strolling street in Kungsholmen Stockholm. Many curious visitors with questions and wishes to join. The answers to these questions can be found on this page. A QR code is placed in the garden to assist in finding the page.

This is my PP1 project: A HTML/CSS frontend web application project, based on user experience design, accessibility and responsiveness.

## Site Objectives

Our site aims to:

## Design

### Colors
The website's color palette intend to harmonize with the site's natural theme and floral imagery. The dark green is employed in the background to provide a solid foundation to complement the vibrant flower photos. Additionally, the use of black and white ensures strong contrast and enhances the readability of the primary content and naviation. Finally, a touch of pink has been reserved for call-to-action and signup button for added emphasis.

- Merriweater is used for body text and headers to match the organic content

The website consists of three main pages:
